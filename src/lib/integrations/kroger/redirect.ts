/**
 * Resolve the Kroger OAuth redirect URI from the current request.
 *
 * Prism can be reached via multiple hosts (e.g. https://prism.tallacker.com
 * over WAN and http://192.168.1.236:3000 on LAN). The OAuth redirect URI
 * must match the host the user started the flow from — Kroger validates
 * that the URI sent to /token matches the one sent to /authorize, and the
 * post-auth redirect needs to land back on the same origin so the user's
 * Prism session cookie is sent.
 *
 * The user registers BOTH URIs in their Kroger app config; this function
 * picks the right one based on the incoming request.
