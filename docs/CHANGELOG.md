# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Security / Infrastructure
- **Redis-down 503**: `validateSession` now returns a discriminated union `{ ok, reason }` — Redis unavailability returns 503 ("service unavailable") instead of 401 ("please log in"), preventing confusing auth errors during infra outages
- **Request ID middleware**: All API responses include `x-request-id` header (24-char hex UUID); propagated into `logError()` for log correlation across distributed traces
- **`/api/health/deep`** (parent-auth): Deep health check verifying DB, Redis, last backup recency, and OAuth token expiry; triggers optional `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` notification on degradation
- **`apiError()` helper**: Standardized error responses via `src/lib/api/apiResponse.ts` — `{ error: { code, message } }` shape with typed codes: `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`
- **withAuth migration**: birthdays, calendar-notes routes migrated from raw `requireAuth` boilerplate to `withAuth` wrapper

### Performance
- **FamilyProvider**: Equality check on polling results before calling `setMembers` — prevents unnecessary re-renders across all consumers on every 10-minute poll when data is unchanged

### Docs / Guidelines
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added API error standardization, cache invalidation, auth degradation, testing, and request ID guidelines

### Security
- **CSRF**: Next.js middleware validates `Origin` header on all API mutations — cross-origin requests blocked at the edge (away-mode auto-activation exempt)
- **WiFi config**: Password now stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in the database; decrypted on read with backward-compat for existing plaintext rows
- **Backups**: `PGPASSWORD` moved from inline shell string to process env — prevents credential leakage in process listings
- **Babysitter info**: Sensitive section content now requires authentication (`includeSensitive=true` requests gated behind `requireAuth`)
- **Paprika import**: HTML payload capped at 5 MB — prevents memory exhaustion from oversized uploads

### Performance
- **Caching**: Messages, Tasks, and Photos GET endpoints now cache responses in Redis (60s / 60s / 300s TTLs) — reduces DB load on frequently-polled dashboard data
- **Visibility polling**: `useCalendarEvents` and `usePhotos` now use `useVisibilityPolling` — polling pauses when the browser tab is hidden
- **Images**: Replaced raw `<img>` tags with `next/image` (lazy loading, layout stability) in RecipeCard, RecipeDetailModal, and all four nav components (avatar images)

### Improved
- **Tasks**: Group control split into a "Group" primary select and a "Then by" secondary select — the nested `Person → List` / `List → Person` arrow-notation options are replaced by two independent dropdowns; "Then by" only appears when a groupable primary is chosen and task lists exist
- **Chores**: "Group by Person" toggle replaced with a consistent "Group" dropdown (None / Person) matching Tasks' style

### Tests
- **Auth enumeration**: Jest tests verify requireAuth routes return 401 and getDisplayAuth routes are correctly guest-accessible (`src/app/api/__tests__/authEnumeration.test.ts`)
- **Widget smoke tests**: 14 render tests for ChoresWidget, TasksWidget, ShoppingWidget covering empty state, data display, and filtering (`src/components/widgets/__tests__/widgetRender.test.tsx`)
- **Jest config**: Added `.test.tsx` to testMatch; ts-jest now overrides `jsx: react-jsx` for component test files

### Docs
- **API auth levels**: Added `docs/api-auth-levels.md` documenting the auth requirement (Public / Display / Auth / Parent) for every API route

### Refactor
- **Days**: Consolidated 8 inline day-of-week arrays across calendar views, chore modals, WeatherWidget, and the OpenWeather integration into shared `DAYS_SHORT_ARRAY`, `DAYS_LONG_ARRAY`, and `DAYS_SINGLE_ARRAY` constants in `src/lib/constants/days.ts`
- **CalendarWidget**: Extracted `useCalendarWidgetPrefs` hook (view state, navigation, localStorage persistence) and `CalendarWidgetControls` sub-component — main component reduced from ~357 to ~200 lines
- **Widgets**: Added `useMemo` for filter/sort chains and `useCallback` for event handlers in ChoresWidget, TasksWidget, ShoppingWidget, and MealsWidget

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Tasks**: Person→List and List→Person nested group modes — primary group cards with sub-group sections inside (colored left-border dividers, per-sub-group badge counts). Available in the Group dropdown when task lists exist.
- **Undo Stack**: Global undo across shopping, tasks, wishes, and chores — undo button in the nav bar reverses the most recent mutation
- **Dashboard Editor**: Transparent background mode — widget cards can render over the grid background image without a double-card effect
- **Dashboard Editor**: Per-widget text color and opacity controls
- **Dashboard Editor**: Custom color picker for theme palette swatches
- **Dashboard Editor**: Grid line opacity and cell background color/opacity controls for calendar and weather widgets
- **Camera Scanner**: Scan product barcodes with phone/tablet camera on the Shopping page — camera icon in header opens full-screen scanner overlay; automatically looks up product on Open Food Facts and adds it to the active list
- **Docker**: Multi-arch builds (amd64 + arm64) — Raspberry Pi support via pre-built GHCR image
- **Health check**: `GET /api/health` now probes PostgreSQL and Redis — returns 503 with `status: "degraded"` if either is down (previously always returned 200)
- **Calendar**: Profile columns now follow family member sort order from Settings
- **Calendar**: Family calendar group always sorts first before person columns

### Improved
- **Calendar**: Day view and week view hourly rows now expand to fill available widget/subpage height — `1fr` grid rows scale proportionally instead of using a fixed minimum
- **Bus Tracker**: Train map switches to 2-row snake layout when 6+ nodes — top row left→right, bottom row right→left, connected by a right-side vertical segment
- **Bus Tracker**: PM route at-school status now shows "Bus at school — en route" instead of a bogus 0-minute ETA
- **Bus Tracker**: Route dialog "Scheduled" field renamed to "Home ETA" with helper text clarifying it is the expected arrival time at your stop
- **Bus Tracker**: Large minute values now display as hours and minutes (e.g., "15h 25m" instead of "925m")
- **README**: Replaced GIF demos with static screenshots for faster loading

### Security
- **Rate limiting**: In-memory fallback limiter — rate limits now enforced even when Redis is unavailable (previously all requests passed through)
- **Backups**: `POST /api/admin/backups` rate-limited to 5 per hour per user
- **API**: `GET /api/settings` now requires display auth — previously exposed all app configuration unauthenticated
- **API**: `GET /api/settings/wifi` now requires auth — previously exposed Wi-Fi credentials unauthenticated
- **API**: `POST /api/shopping/scan` now requires display auth — previously allowed unauthenticated writes to shopping list

### Fixed
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Tapping a key no longer dismisses the keyboard after one character — `preventDefault` on `pointerDown` keeps focus in the active input field
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Toggle button now appears correctly on touchscreen laptops where Windows converts touch events to mouse events (uses `navigator.maxTouchPoints` instead of pointer type tracking)
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Reduced height from 38vh to 32vh — less intrusive on 1080p displays
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Scroll position no longer jumps after voice input adds a new list item — scroll restore is skipped when text was injected while the keyboard was open
- **Camera Scanner**: Overlay now self-dismisses immediately after a successful scan — no longer stays open waiting for parent state propagation
- **Camera Scanner**: Haptic feedback (`navigator.vibrate`) on successful scan (Android; iOS does not support web vibration)
- **Camera Scanner**: iOS photo mode — AudioContext unlocked synchronously on "Open Camera" tap to maximise audio feedback compatibility
- **UI**: Desktop/laptop font size reduced to 14px base (via `pointer: fine` media query) — previously used the same 16px as touch displays, making the UI feel oversized on mouse-driven monitors
- **Calendar**: Day name headers rotate correctly when week starts on Monday
- **Mobile**: Navigation no longer causes flash/slide animation on page transitions
- **Docker**: App health check uses node instead of curl (not available in Alpine)
- **Docker**: Fresh install schema fixed (removed duplicate function and restrict lines from pg_dump)
- **Docker**: `VirtualKeyboard` and `CameraScannerOverlay` now loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` — prevents `HTMLInputElement is not defined` crash during Next.js prerender on fresh builds
- **Database**: Truncate operation now includes all tables (gift_ideas, calendar_notes, wish_items, bus_tracking, audit_logs)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions upgraded from Node.js 20 to 22
- **CI**: Layout validation size constraints downgraded to warnings

- **Settings**: Location card wired to weather API — supports zip code or city/state, stored in database
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Quality standards requiring 95% minimum Lighthouse score across all categories
- **Drag Reorder**: Tasks, chores, goals, and family profile cards can now be reordered by drag-and-drop (touch + mouse supported)

- **Undo**: Tasks, chores, shopping items, and wish claims now show an "Undo" toast button when completed/checked off
- **Wishes**: Self-purchase — cross off items on your own wish list; if someone else already secretly bought it, shows "Someone already got this for you!"
- **Wishes**: Quick-add input moved to top of list (consistent with tasks/chores pattern)
- **Messages**: "Group by Person" toggle groups messages into person-colored cards

### Improved
- **Settings**: Consolidated Screensaver Timeout, Auto-Hide Navigation, and Away Mode Auto-Activation into single "Timers & Auto-Activation" card
- **Calendar**: Multi-week toolbar no longer resizes when switching views — grid icon doubles as border toggle
- **Calendar**: Multi-week today highlight preserved in screensaver mode (data-keep-bg attribute)
- **SideNav**: Tap-to-expand drawer replaces hover-based expansion — works reliably on touch devices, collapses on outside tap or navigation
- **Weather**: Location resolved from DB settings with fallback chain (query param → DB → env var → default)
- **Screensaver**: Fixed `--primary` CSS variable override that turned today highlight bar white
- **Accessibility**: Dashboard editor uses dashed border for move mode, solid for resize — distinguishable without color

### Fixed
- **Navigation**: Fixed nav bar appearing behind page content on iPad — removed wrapper divs that created CSS containing blocks breaking `position: fixed`
- **Navigation**: Fixed auto-hide SSR hydration mismatch — localStorage read deferred to useEffect
- **Navigation**: Auto-hide now limited to dashboard pages only — no more jarring nav animations on subpages
- **Google Calendar**: Fixed events beyond 250-event page being silently dropped — added pagination loop following `nextPageToken`
- **Google Calendar**: Cancelled recurring event instances now filtered out during sync instead of appearing as active events
- **Bus Tracking**: Fixed token mismatch between discover and sync — stale Gmail credentials now deleted on `TokenRevokedError`
- **Layout Editor**: Added `busTracking` to widget validation constraints (fixes "unknown widget ID" error)
- **Layout Editor**: Fixed dashboard save showing "Saved!" but not actually persisting — save button now awaits the API call and shows error on failure
- **Safe Zones**: Shortened default label from "Example safe zone (edit me)" to "1080p" to prevent preview cutoff
- **Calendar**: Multi-day all-day events now span all their days instead of only appearing on the start date (affected all calendar views + widget)

### Improved

### Fixed
- **Recipes**: Fixed crash when opening "Add Recipe" form (missing optional chain on ingredients)
- **Layout Editor (iPad)**: Fix scrolling stopping too early — grid now extends 20+ rows (or half a screen) below the last widget
- **Layout Editor (iPad)**: Fix touch drag not working — tap to select a widget, then drag to move (selected widgets disable browser scroll so dnd-kit receives the gesture)
- **Layout Editor (iPad)**: Enforce minimum 16px cell size so grid remains usable on narrow screens
- **Layout Editor**: Add "Move" grip indicator on selected widgets for touch discoverability
- **Bus Tracking**: Fix arrival event timestamps off by 6 hours in UTC Docker containers — arrival parsers now use the email Date header (timezone-correct) instead of parsing body text times as naive UTC

### Changed
- **Dashboard Grid**: Migrated from 12-column to 48-column grid for finer widget positioning (~20px increments vs ~80px)
  - All existing layouts auto-migrate on load (coordinates scaled 4x)
  - Shared `GRID_COLS` constant as single source of truth

  - Removes 5 packages from bundle (react-grid-layout and dependencies)
- **Performance**: Lighthouse optimization pass (desktop score: 52 → 96)
  - Lazy-load overlays (Screensaver, AwayMode, BabysitterMode) — broke transitive import chain that pulled entire widget registry into root layout
  - Extract screensaver storage utilities to break circular dependency between Screensaver and useDashboardLayout
  - Lazy-load Add modals (task, message, chore, shopping) — deferred from critical path
  - Add React.memo to eager-loaded widgets (Clock, Weather, Calendar) to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Lighthouse accessibility score 92 → 100
  - Fix WCAG color contrast: rewrite `isLightColor` with proper sRGB linearization and WCAG contrast ratio calculation
  - Fix calendar "Today" badge using white text on yellow seasonal highlight background
  - Add `aria-label` to all sidebar nav links (text hidden when collapsed)
  - Add `aria-label` to logo home link
- **Bus Tracking**: Auto-sync emails on status poll (60s Redis debounce lock)
- **Bus Tracking**: Switch from `is:unread` to label+date Gmail filtering for email sync
  - Supports Gmail filters that skip inbox and route to a label (e.g. "bus")
  - Configurable Gmail label in Settings → Bus Tracking
  - Uses DB dedup (gmailMessageId) instead of marking emails as read
  - Date-windowed search (last 24h) keeps queries efficient

  - Active days awareness: no false "overdue" status on weekends/non-school days
  - Fuzzy location matching for stop/school name abbreviations
  - API routes for status, sync, routes CRUD, connection management, history, and discovery

- **Calendar Re-auth Flow**: Detect expired/revoked Google Calendar tokens, show warning in Settings with "Re-authenticate" button that updates existing calendar source tokens

### Fixed
- **Calendar Sync**: Token refresh failures now detect `invalid_grant` errors specifically and mark calendars as needing re-authentication instead of showing generic errors
- **Task Creation**: Fixed "Failed to create task" error when using + button with list filter set to "none"
- **Day View Hidden Hours**: Hour rows now expand to fill available space when hidden hours are enabled, instead of leaving blank space at the bottom

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Transparent widget background**: New "Transparent" swatch (checkerboard icon) in Fill palette strips the Card background entirely, letting wallpaper show through
- **Widget text color**: New "Text" section in properties bar lets you override text/icon color per widget (Auto mode uses luminance detection or theme default)
- **Calendar transparent mode**: When calendar widget has custom/transparent background, day cell backgrounds are removed so wallpaper shows through the entire widget

### Fixed
- **Text color persistence**: Widget text color now saves to database (was being stripped by API validation)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Background opacity**: Widget background opacity no longer makes text/icons transparent — uses rgba background color instead of CSS opacity
- **Color picker touch targets**: Increased button sizes to meet 44px HIG minimum, prevented RGL drag from intercepting touch events on color picker
- **Pencil icon**: Edit icon in dashboard toolbar now opens rename dialog on click
- **Rename dialog**: Replaced browser `window.prompt()` with styled modal dialog (consistent with v1.0 polish)

- **SSRF Protection**: Recipe URL import validates against private IP ranges, localhost, and internal hostnames
- **Rate Limiting**: Recipe URL import limited to 10 requests per 60 seconds per user
- **Docker Resource Limits**: Container memory and CPU caps (app: 2GB/2CPU, db: 2GB/2CPU, redis: 512MB/1CPU) with Redis LRU eviction policy
